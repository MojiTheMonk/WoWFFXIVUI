A World of Warcraft user interface setup based on that of Final Fantasy XIV. Included are folders including required Addons, custom textures, saved variables, and an installation guide illustrating where to place the files once they are downloaded. A folder containing profile imports for ElvUI and ConsolePort are included as well, though they should not be required. Make sure to keep your addons up to date after installation. 

Individual WeakAura imports can be found at the following links:
